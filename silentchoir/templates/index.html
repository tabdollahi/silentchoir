                If you have been the victim of abuse in the workplace, at school, at home, or anywhere at all,

                    <p>The statistics of sexual assault paint a disturbing picture. Estimates are that 60% to 90% of sexual abuse goes unreported. Meanwhile, 70% of victims can identify their offender because it is a friend, a co-worker, neighbor or a relative. In addition, sexual abuse is a crime that is typically recommitted.</p>
                    
                    <p>All this means that certain offenders can carry on recommitting abuses against dozens of victims for decades.</p>
                    
                    <p>This ends now.</p>

                    <h4 class="colHeader">ABOUT US</h4>

                    <p>We are a group of survivors, allies, and techies, looking to empower those who have survived experiences they may be uncomfortable sharing.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 colText">
                    <h4 class="colHeader">OUR PLATFORM</h4>
                    <p>We are working to democratize the tools that have been available to the victims of such high profile cases as Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Silent Choir is a secure, safe, reporting tool for survivors who would like to name their offender(s). Based on anonymous reports submitted through our site, we aim to connect survivors who have been harassed or abused by the same offender.</p>
                    
                    <p>By connecting survivors in this way, we hope to create a path to accountability that may pave the way towards healing.</p>
                   
                    <p>The Silent Choir is a closed system. Reports are not searchable or discoverable by anybody. Reports or personal details are not shared with anybody. Our only goal is simply to privately and securely connect survivors who share a common offender.</p>
                   
                    <p>Reports are always encrypted and untraceable, and participants decide whether or not to connect with other survivors. Reports are not shared with law enforcement without prior consent or notice. Reports remain completely anonymous unless requested otherwise by the participant submitting them. Reports will not be shared with anybody -- not even those with whom you share an offender with -- without explicit consent. The sole purpose of a report is for us to be able to make meaningful connections between anonymous survivors.</p>
                    
                    <p>You can abandon your report and delete it entirely at any time and note that we do not store any of your data.</p>
